                <p>I'm Andreas, from Kristianstad with a strong interest in science and technology. As a child I spent
                    hours building with lego, figuring out how to create structures and models. In secondary
                    school, I studied IT-Media, which gave me a chance to explore programming and digitaldesign. Today,
                    I'm
                    working toward a career in a medical field where I can apply scientific
                    knowledge in a hands-on way. While I'm deeply interested in chemistry and how it relates to health,
                    I also enjoy programming as a creative outlet. I enjoy the process of taking an idea and turning it
                    into something functional, even if it is just a hobby. I balance my studies with visiting museums
                    and traveling whenever I get the chance.</p>

            <h2>Academic interests & hobbies</h2>
            <p>I became interested in programming because it was fun to make something out of nothing. There's something
                satisfying about writing a few lines of code, eventually turn into something more complex with time.
            </p>

                <li><strong>Develop applications</strong> - Using diffrent languages such as Java and C#</li>
                <li><strong>Visit museums</strong> - Exploring history and science exhibits</li>
                <li><strong>Traveling</strong> - Experiencing new countries</li>

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>Future goals</h2>
            <p>My primary goal is to work in a medical field. This goal matters to me because I want to be part of work
                that genuinely helps people and makes a difference in their health and everyday lives. I have always
                enjoyed working with my hands, and I find it rewarding when I can do something practical and see the
                results of my effort. That is one of the reasons a medical career feels like the right path for me. At
                the same time, I want programming to stay a meaningful hobby in my life. I enjoy the creativity
                it gives me, and also how I can sit down, focus on a problem and slowly build a solution in my own
                way.</p>
